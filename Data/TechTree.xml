    <Details>Some civilizations simply don't inspire others to be like them.||For instance, the Drengin tend to have a hard time convincing others of the universality of their way of life. Part of this stems from the Drengin attitude that all races must either submit to slavery or be wiped out. And by attitude, we mean the habit of Drengin literally conquering other species and enslaving them in the most cruel ways.||Civilizations like the Drengin do "get it". They understand that there are negative PR consequences to their continual habit of wanting to destroy everyone. That's where Xeno Propaganda comes in.||Xeno Propaganda works mostly to keep the influence of alien cultures from permeating native worlds.||In essence, Xeno Propaganda says this: "Sure, we might enslave people and the odds of dying in agony are high in our civilization and sure those other guys seem to be living it up and having a great old time but ignore them because they suck."||While not effective at increasing morale, Xeno Propaganda does improve the influence of a planet which often needs that influence to ward off alien culture.</Details>

    <DisplayName>Jihad of Krynn</DisplayName>
    <Description>Increases civilization influence and morale.</Description>
    <Details>The sad narrative of our galaxy is that races seem inclined to commit genocide against other races on their home worlds. The Altarians and Drath once shared a home world. The Yor and Iconians once shared a home world. The Drengin and Korath once shared a home world. The Arnor and Dread Lords used to share a home world when they were known as the Precursors. Even the diplomatic humans shared a home world with the Neanderthals who were exterminated prior to the rise of modern human civilization.||But the Krynn are different. The Krynn home world started out with multiple sentient races. The Krynn, you see, are not a race but rather a people made up of many different sentient species. Tied together with a unifying culture, the Krynn (which loosely translates into "the way") believe they have unlocked the secrets to the universe and are on a holy mission to share these secrets with the universe.||The Jihad of Krynn is split between three technological branches. The first branch outlines the laws and order of the Krynn. These allow the construction of powerful centers for indoctrination which uniquely increase morale while spreading influence. The second branch spreads the way into the galaxy in extremely powerful influence modules for starbases.||The third technology branch expands on the espionage super ability of the Krynn. Because the Krynn is a faith and not a species, they have, by far, the best spies in the galaxy. The human or Arcean or even Drengin you see at a star port could, in fact, by a spy for the Krynn because a any race could be a Krynn.||What the Krynn may lack in technological sophistication they make up for in their ability to convert other species to their way. They can, after all, make the case that the Krynn have learned to share their world successfully for eons. With the galaxy full of evidence that other species, even the peaceful Altarians, ultimately fall into genocidal tendencies, the Krynn way of life has a growing appeal in a hostile galaxy.</Details>

Whereas the Law of Krynn tells people how to live, the Order of Krynn provides a deeper understanding of why people should live this way.||The fundamental tenet of the faith of the Krynn is that the law and order of the Krynn holds up under both scientific and religious scrutiny. It is internally consistent.||Put another way, the Krynn believe that faith is only required to those who only have an imperfect understanding of the Krynn. As one's grasp of the Krynn improves, the need for faith decreases. The Order of the Krynn is the step between following the law of the Krynn on faith and truly knowing "the way" as being a fundamental truth of the universe.||The Order of the Krynn can now be constructed on all of our worlds and provides immense morale (approval rating) increases as well as influence increases.</Details>

    <DisplayName>The Way</DisplayName>
    <Description>Provides a greater understanding of the universe.</Description>
    <Details>The Way represents the ultimate direction for people to live their lives. The Krynn believe in a supreme being (what humans would call "God") who created the universe and then sent 4 guardians to safeguard the universe.||These guardians watched over the massive crystal that the creator had put into the universe for the time when life would be added to the universe. The crystal would be used at a time when the universe was ready for life to exist. However, a 5th entity, a demon, came into the universe and attempted to corrupt the crystal. In doing so, the crystal was shattered and every tiny fragment of the crystal that came into contact with the right conditions began life across the universe.||The Krynn have put this belief to the test and have proven to their satisfaction the existence of what others call "dark energy". It is the invisible energy that the Precursors use. Their belief also predicted the existence of a "big bang" long before the science existed to provide rationale for that theory.||The Krynn believe that only through intensifying their sentience can they achieve salvation. Salvation, to the Krynn, means being able to exist as a sentient being of energy after the body has perished. The only way to intensify ones sentience is through converting others to The Way. The Krynn believe that all Krynn are connected and thus the more Krynn there are, the more intense the connections between them.||The existence of machinery that can harness the sentient energy of creatures (such as what the Drengin and Korath have) helps prove (according to the Krynn) that The Way ultimately requires no faith once one has full understanding.||Therefore, the Krynn must convert all sentient beings into being the Krynn even if it means bloodshed. The very afterlife of the Krynn is dependent on bringing the universe over to The Way. Even those who have long perished in body gain in sentience when new converts are added. Thus, the Krynn do not convert merely to save their own souls but to save the souls of all the Krynn who have ever lived.</Details>

    <Description>Generates massive amounts of power.</Description>
    <Details>Hyper Fusion Reactors were the keystone of true interstellar travel. Fusion power provided enough energy to allow physicists and engineers to begin contemplating concepts and applications that required immense amounts of energy.||From fusion reactors a myriad of new technologies become possible or at least, theoretical. Artificial gravity, teleportation, folding space, and so forth.||It was the youthful humans on Sol 3 that managed to truly master fusion reactors. And one of their first applications of fusion reactors was the creation of portable stargates that became known as Hyperdrive.||Fusion reactors rely on Deuterium which is found across the galaxy in water. The other key ingredient is lithium which is common on most inner planets in star systems.||In a fusion reaction, energy is produced when two atoms join together to form one. Hydrogen atoms come together to form helium atoms, neutrons and vast amounts of energy.||The ancient empires of the galaxy, notably the Drengin Empire and Arcean Empires both have had fusion reaction for eons. They believed that they had mastered it as far as it could go. Their fusion reactions made use of magnetic confinement which uses magnetic fields to heat and compress hydrogen plasma. While this method works and has been used for thousands of years in both the Drengin Empire and Arcean Empires, it requires a great deal of physical space to work.||The stargates use fusion provided through magnetic confinement which is one of the reasons they are so large.||The humans, by contrast, took both approaches but eventually chose inertial confinement, a different method and one completely unexplored by the other civilizations. Inertial confinement uses laser beams or ion beams to compress and heat the hydrogen plasma.||The advantage of this is that laser beams and ion beams benefit from military technology. That is, the fragmented nation states on the human homeworld of Earth led to constant improvements in these kinds of technologies which in turn improved the fusion reactions.||The concept of Hyperfusion reactions is more of an evolution or marketing term to conventional fusion reactions. Instead of the reactor having to be the size of a small city, the reactor can fit into a 2500 cube-meter volume.</Details>

A ship travels effectively one adjusted-parsec (pc) per week (.165 light-years per week).

The first way is to bend space more. That's basically all Hyperdrive does. Ships still cannot move very fast in normal space; so Hyperdrive used immense amounts of energy in order to slightly warp space to make a one light-year trip seem the same as taking a 10 million mile trip. The second way to make ships travel faster is to increase how fast they move in normal space. Bigger thrusters and what have you.

It is a much more efficient method to warp space so that even if the energy levels are the same as previous drive technologies, space is warped by a far greater extent. Space is warped by default by a magnitude that triples the original Hyperdrive ratio.||If we actually take advantage of the new HyperWarp system's capabilities for making use of greater amounts of energy, we could see ships that can move a dozen parsecs in a single week.</Details>

    <DisplayName>Interstellar Navigation</DisplayName>
    <Description>Specially trained navigators allow our ships to travel faster.</Description>
    <Details>The humans were very effective in coming up with brute force technology to travel faster. But there are other paths to moving faster.||Interstellar navigation works by having specially trained space navigators on board ships who can find more effective ways through folded space.||What isn't understood by most civilizations is that hyperspace is not some perfect tube that ships move through. A straight path through the folded space is not the fastest way. This is because bodies of mass have a detrimental effect on the absolute speed of a ship moving through warped space.||The concept of mass affecting ship speed is very well known already. That is why all galactic maps present planets and stars relatively close to one another with planets still a modified parsec away.||Two stars are extremely far away from one another compared to planets within a star system. But on a galactic map, a planet is displayed almost as far away from a star as the next star. This is due to the mass effect on hyperdrive.||But Interstellar Navigators can make a big difference by navigating a ship more effectively through hyperspace and avoid areas of mass that would normally slow down a ship. A ship with an interstellar navigator on board may take the ship on what would seem like a zig-zag course but at the galactic level they are simply avoiding mass bubbles in space, resulting in faster travel.||Interstellar Navigators require specialized training between a Navigation Center on a planet and the ship they are assigned to. So there is a significant overhead involved in this method. But the results can be dramatic.</Details>

    <Description>A more efficient revision of Hyperdrive.</Description>
    <Details>As previously discussed, Hyperdrive works as essentially a brute force method of using energy to fold space and having the ship move in a direct path through folded space. Areas of significant mass can have a massive effect on the relative speed of a ship (i.e. where there are stars and planets, the ship moves much slower).||Sub-Space Drive is still Hyperdrive but is far more intelligent. It works by automatically avoiding areas of local large mass (or at least reducing it). The ship no longer flies in a direct straight line but instead makes micro corrections to avoid mass when possible. This provides some of the capability of an interstellar navigator but still gives time for a navigator to make even more efficient course adjustments.||The net result is that our ships will travel faster.</Details>

    <DisplayName>Stellar Folding</DisplayName>
    <Description>An ultra advanced propulsion system.</Description>
    <Details>Stellar Folding takes the concept of folding space and brings it to a scary place. Stellar Folding actually injects tremendous energy into higher order dimensions in order to fold space to a much greater degree.||To use an analogy, Hyper Drive and everything that came after it essentially warps space by sending a high stream of energy into the next dimension and folding space. If one were to think of space as a napkin on a table, hyper drive essentially grabs an area in front of the napskin and pulls it toward the ship reducing the absolute distance the ship has to travel.||Subsequent advances in hyper drive technology (Impulse, Warp Drive, etc.) are essentially marketing names for being able to send this high stream of energy further ahead.||But Stellar Folding works on a somewhat different principle. It essentially lifts the napskin up and begins to fold the entire napkin. The actual distance of the destination becomes irrelevant because it can begin folding at any point in the universe because the folding is occurring outside of space/time. The only limiting factor is energy. With infinite energy, one could use Stellar Folding to travel to any point in the galaxy instantaneously. The repercussions of this are quite disconcerting as it would mean that eventually someone would be able to essentially teleport themselves or their fleets to any point in the universe (not just within a galaxy but in the entire 14 billion light year diameter of the universe).||Fortunately or unfortunately for us, our energy capacity is quite finite but it does allow us to travel faster than ever before.</Details>

    <Description>Allows construction of ships designed for interstellar travel.</Description>
    <Details>The ability to design containers that are required to travel immense distances and survive extended periods of time in the vacuum of space is no trivial task.||Prior to space travel, civilizations with a lively tradition of science fiction tended to downplay or completely ignore what precisely was involved in producing things that travel from star to star.||Space, as is well known, is big. It's mind boggling big. But it is not nearly as empty as people believe. As early space explorers learned, often the hard way, traveling even between planets is hazardous.||Many early engineers focused almost totally on the propulsion of a ship rather than the actual construction of a ship. To many engineers, space travel was essentially putting either robots or organic travelers into a metal box and attaching propulsion. Not so at all.||First, these metal tubes in the vacuum of space are subjected to radiations that could scarcely be imagined by terrestrial scientists. Secondly, once outside the gravity well of a planet system, the metal tubes were routinely subjected to micro meteorites. Flecks of asteroids or bits of metal flying through space at hundreds of meters per second.||The intersection of a space ship and flecks of high speed metal resulted in the shredding of said space ship.||Interstellar construction is a technology that allows for the construction of better, more efficient, and more durable star ships.</Details>

The reality is, most life forms are only barely sentient -- they are barely aware of their conscious actions.

    <Description>Allows for interstellar travel and gravity channeling.</Description>
    <Details>Artificial Gravity is a technology that is the direct result of having immense amounts of energy at hand. The applications of artificial gravity are both obvious and subtle.||The obvious application is that ships can now travel for extended periods through space with native gravity levels without compromising the ship design with fragile and unreliable physical motion devices (i.e. ships do not have to spin their hulls to maintain gravity).||The historical fleets of the Drengin Empire and the Arcean Empire in the pre-artificial gravity era are very obvious. Their hulls spin on a super conducting pivot powered by regulated micro bursts of thrust to keep the spinning consistent. Needless to say, these ships would not be reliable in battle.||The Drengin fleet that conquered the Torian home world in the pre-hyperdrive era were all without artificial gravity and relied on a stargate that still resulted in a travel time of nearly a year. Two of the troop carriers in that journey had a malfunction in their rotational axis control during the journey resulting in having over 25,000 Drengin shock troops having to live out their remaining lives in space.||Fortunately, the lives of those Drengin shock troops was short since they were soon converted into fuel. Another key use is that it can be used to channel gravity on planets which allows for more serious planetary improvements.</Details>

    <DisplayName>Slave Pits</DisplayName>
    <Description>Increase production through dedicated slave pits.</Description>
    <Details>The manufacturing base of some cultures is based almost entirely on slavery. Physical labor is considered too lowly to be considered honorable by some races.||This tendency, ironically, is amplified in the races who have had routine automation technology for a long while. Whereas races who have not had technology for as long of a time (humans, Altarians, Torians for three examples) tend to make use of factories filled with citizens or various forms of robotic automation, others consider such a thing to be unworthy of them.||For example, civilizations such as the Drengin (or their Korathian cousins) don't tend to even bother researching robotic automation because even designing constructs that do manual labor is considered demeaning and dishonorable.||The large (and growing) population of slaves in these empires have allowed the Drengin Empire and others like them to perfect slave labor (if such a term can be considered perfected).||Slave Pits are as the name implies. Vast pits in which "slavelings" toil to produce. While slave pits don't tend to be nearly as productive as human factories, the Drengin make use of readily available Death Furnaces to more than compensate.||The downside of Slave Pits is that they diminish the planet's influence upon the galaxy. As impressive as slave pits are as a feat of manufacturing and engineering, they do not inspire other civilizations to want to join in knowing that only a small twist of fate could bring them to be working in these pits.</Details>

They claim the concept was originally from the Precursors (most likely the faction of Precursors called Dread Lords) who believed that Aul (what humans might call a 'soul') can be harvested and turned into a form of powerful energy.||According to legend, the Precursors had immense amounts of this type of energy which, for lack of a better term, is called 'dark energy'. This energy was native to their existence and is the basis of their power.||Apparently, the 'younger races', such as Drengin, human, Arcean, and so forth, possess small amounts of this dark energy that can be extracted from the Aul through these Death Furnaces.||The net result is that Death Furnaces can greatly amplify the production capacity of factories, slave pits, etc.</Details>

    <Description>Key energy and matter technology.</Description>
    <Details>Gravitrons are the elementary particle of the universe. The universe exists in 11 dimensions. Some of the civilizations have a basic understanding of what they call "String Theory". In String theory, all matter is produced based on different frequencies of sub-atomic particles called strings. What they do not yet understand is that these strings all rest on an arbitrary edge of an even more elementary particle called a Gravitron. While they are correct that vibrating strings create all matter and energy, they do not yet realize that these strings are not arbitrarily positioned. The gravitron is 11-sided -- one for each dimension of the universe and each edge has its own strings. Beings of a given dimension can only perceive a limited number of these edges (beings in the third dimension can perceive 3 sides but do not realize that all strings they are aware of are directed in one of three predictable angles because they cannot perceive the other 8 angles).||Gravitronics matters because once gravitrons (not to be confused with gravitons) can be harnessed, any conventional power system can be easily enhanced to produce 2^8th more power than it would normally produce.||Basic Gravitronics is about as far as we can get in this space-time because while our scientists on hand know the basics of Gravitronics, our colonization fleet did not bring anyone with an expert level understanding of gravitronics.||All of our key material and energy research rests on our understanding of how the universe actually works. The net benefit is that our ability to research technologies that other civilizations have equivalents of will take less time because they are making use of trial and error in their experiments where-as we are approaching our technological achievements through a more thorough understanding of the universe.</Details>

It is not something they can do quickly, it takes many hours to do, but they can mimic to a significant degree most of the species of the galaxy. They are particularly good at emulating the Altarians (and thereby humans).||Because the [YOURSHORTCIVNAME] tend to have lower populations than other civilizations, they have had to find more subtle ways to achieve their ends. Because of their long history of being near the Altarians, they learned to survive through manipulation rather than brute force. While an individual of [YOURSHORTCIVNAME] is mightier than any other individual in the known galaxy (even a Drengin), they simply lack the numbers.||The Invisible Hand helps the [YOURSHORTCIVNAME] to stay out of trouble and let others do the work for them. When civilizations are at war, the [YOURSHORTCIVNAME] now receive a small percentage of the income being put into war production.

    <DisplayName>Precursor History</DisplayName>
    <Description>Learn the history of the Precursors.</Description>
    <Details>The Precursors were the first sentient species. They didn't call themselves Precursors naturally. They called themselves Arnor. They didn't evolve. They were made. Religion and myth have clouded the specifics of the very beginning. What we have learned (i.e. according to Precursor artifacts that have been found and translated) is that there were once 5 "guardians of the universe" who were sent to ensure that life would come to exist in the universe when the proper time came. Where they came from is unknown. But what is known to the Precursors is that the object the Guardians were to take care of was known as the Telenanth. It was a crystal of some kind (as best we can tell) that when unleashed into the universe would allow inorganic matter to become organic. The line between the two is apparently a lot thinner than previously believed (or more exactly, what the Mithrilar consider living is probably a lot looser than what we today would consider living). The Mithrilar would probably even consider proteins to be life as apparently they did not exist prior to the unleashing of the Telenanth.||According to what we have learned of the Precursors, the Mithrilar used the Telenanth to actually change the laws of physics as we know them in the universe in such a way to allow for certain types of molecular bonds to be able to form. We cannot see how this is possible as the laws of physics are absolute and any change to them would make the universe as we know it impossible. But the Precursors certainly believe that the laws of physics are fluid.||Meanwhile, one of the Mithrilar was different from the others. Known as the "Dark Mithrilar" he/it became known as Draginol. Where he originated is unknown even to the Precursors. What is known is that Draginol created the Precursors in his own image. The Arnor, in their natural form, resemble Altarians (and humans) -- this was the Altarian prophecy that came to be seen to be true once actual contact with the Dread Lords occurred. We do not know why Draginol's natural form resembles an Altarian/human. We do know that the other Mithrilar had no specific natural form at all.||The Arnor quickly built a great civilization that eventually spanned the stars across the known universe. The universe was empty with no life on it other than the Arnor and other specific forms of life created by Draginol for their planet. In time, the Telenanth was unleashed and nearly all of the guardians of the universe were no more. With the Mithrilar gone, the Precursors began to observe the rise of new sentient beings evolving across the galaxies.||In our galaxy, the first civilization to become sentient was known as the Iconians. The Arnor became concerned of what the future might hold in a universe teeming with these younger sentient races. One faction wanted to exterminate alien sentient life upon discovery. The other wanted to guide them. In time, this difference in philosophy grew into a civil war. The losing side became villainized and known as the "Dread Lords". The war was long and devastated the galaxies in which it was fought. The Arnor were on the brink of defeat but had constructed a trap to remove the Dread Lords from our dimension and place them in a pocket dimension. With that accomplished, the Precursors disappeared until the Drengin unwittingly released the Dread Lords from the pocket universe. The location of the Arnor home world is still unknown and the Arnor disappeared from the known universe soon after the Dread Lords were banished.||Some other notes about the universe according to the Precursors:||According to what we have learned, as big as the universe is, nearly all of the galaxies are lifeless and that in time, even our galaxy will become lifeless until the end when everything breaks back down to sub-atomic particles again, the price of having a universe capable of the molecular bonds provided by the Telenanth. The Mithrilar also considered all matter other than what we call hydrogen and helium to be miraculous and that all elements other than those two were created due to the Telenanth's initial effect on the singularity force of the universe.</Details>

    <Details>We know that on the planet called Altaria the species called the Drath were first. But due to the unexpected presence of the dark Mithrilar known as Draginol, the evolution on Altaria was altered and a second sentient species evolved and eventually drove the Drath to the edge of extinction. This second sentient species is what are called the Altarians today.||The Drath and the Altarians share nothing in common physically. And in fact, the Drath more closely match other natural species on Altaria. It is the Altarians themselves that defy a logical explanation. For example, the Altarians are the only animal on the planet that have hair. No other animal has hair. How could hair spontaneously evolve? Moreover, hair not only spontaneously evolved but evolved in a manner that has no basis in natural selection.||Our scientists continue to research the meaning behind this.</Details>

    <DisplayName>Way of the Arnor</DisplayName>
    <Description>Learn the philosophies of the Arnor.</Description>
    <Details>In the beginning they were one race. And they really are still one race. But the seeds for the discord between the two factions of the Arnor came in their creation. One group of the Arnor were created with the ability to perceive time. Their creator considered them superior in believing that the perception of time passing is a key to self-awareness and thus full sentience. The other group was created without a sense of time perception. It was thought that this group would eventually be the servant class of the other group.||The ability to perceive time is something that mortals take for granted. Creatures that live a span of a century or so have no concept of eternity. What would it be like to live 1,000 years? What about 10,000 years? What about 100,000 years? It is believed that what twisted the creator of the Arnor was that alone of the Mithrilar, the Arnorian creator did indeed perceive time and that perception ultimately ruined his spirit.||For a long while, the Arnorians worked together and indeed, the pre-Dread Lord Arnor were the masters and the base-Arnor were the servants. Those who feel the touch of time are more driven to achievement than those who recognize eternity for what it is. But in time, those who became Dread Lords became cruel and malevolent. When new species began to evolve the Dread Lords considered them worthless. What value is a creature that dies in the relative blink of an eye? What level of awareness of sentience can a being achieve in such a short amount of time?||And so ultimately, the only real difference between the Arnor and Dread Lords is the perception of time and its effect on immortal beings.</Details>

    <Description>Learn the philosophy of the Dread Lords.</Description>
    <Details>The Dread Lords differed from the Arnor in that they perceived the passage of time. The Arnor were a wasted effort from the perspective of the Dread Lords. Power without purpose is evil in their eyes and the Arnor never had any purpose other than to exist.||A popular story told to an Iconian long ago was representative of how the Arnor and the Dread Lords viewed the meaning of life. When an Arnor first saw a glacier, he sat and watched its ebb and flow over centuries -- doing nothing else. Because to an Arnor, time meant nothing. They don't eat food. They don't need to sleep. On the galactic scale, seeing such massive change to an environment that glaciers could bring was endlessly fascinating. The same could have been said of plate movement (except that even the Arnor can't survive in the vacuum of space indefinitely and thus could not watch continental plates move easily).||To the Dread Lords, such is a waste. The Dread Lords had endless purposes to achieve in the eternity available to them. It was, for instance, the Dread Lords, not the Arnor, who apparently came to understand that existence was not infinite. That when the Telenanth was unleashed, it altered the laws of physics in the universe causing space to accelerate its expansion which the Dread Lords conclude will mean that eventually matter in the universe will disipate and that even the Dread Lords would pass out of existence. With such understanding, the Dread Lords strove to accomplish things ranging from traveling to other dimensions and realities, mastering the current universe. Seeing if other universes existed and whether they could travel to them. Whether they succeeded is unknown other than the fact that they did manage to discover a pocket universe which, ironically, they were ultimately trapped within.</Details>

Then came the star gates, and while we knew there was intelligent life out there that could potentially be considered dangerous or be conquered by us, it wasn't really feasible.||Today at the international consortium, we have concluded the necessity of setting up a research center to start pondering what to do about Hyperdrive.

Its bigness gives rise to all kinds of problems for us.||One of those problems is that it's big enough to contain other intelligent life forms. We use the term intelligent loosely, for no matter how big the universe is, there are other beings who will want what you have. Unless we plan to hand it over, we will need to defend ourselves. This comes in the form of putting things on our ships that keep them from being damaged, as well as putting things on them that will cause harm to our enemy's ships.||And so that is where space militarization comes in. Now we can go down the path to researching weapons and defenses for our vessels.</Details>

    <Details>Space is not a friendly place. It's unfriendly to the extreme. First, if you try to take a stroll around in it, you'll die. Which, needless to say, could be considered rather rude. But even if you manage to wade around in space inside a hollowed out piece of metal, you are bound to run into others, wading around in their pieces of hollowed out metal, trying to kill you. To that end, we have come up with some thoughts on weapons.||We've come up with three basic types of weapons. First, you've got mass drivers. Bullets are mass drivers. We've been using them for a long time. Cannons in space and all that. The second type is missile technology. We know about missiles: explosive charges put on the end of some sort of guided propulsion. Very good stuff. Lastly, there's beam weapons. Beam weapons we have some idea of as well: Shoot streams of energy into the enemy's ship and hope it blows it up.||So our next step is to focus on those three areas and start getting some weapons - for self-defense of course.</Details>

Some say that a good defense is a strong offense, but those people aren't here right now are they? No. They're probably out there, trying to attack people only to realize that sometimes a good defense is actually a good defense. Equipping our ships with defensive technologies will help them survive the hostile environments of space and more importantly, lower the insurance costs on our ships.||We've got three types of defenses in mind. You've got good old-fashioned armor. You know, like what knights used to wear but better. Various composite materials that we put on our ships that help us absorb damage, particularly from high-density attacks such as mass drivers. We've also theorized about energy based defenses called shields. These "shields" would essentially act as an energy field around our ships that absorb damage, particularly from energy based attacks such as beam weapons. And lastly, there's point defense. Not a very good name is it? Point defense? Marketing is working on that. I prefer to call it "Anti-Missile Defense" myself but whatever. Point defense is designed to shoot out small bits to knock out fragile weapons with explosive heads like missiles, and protect us from getting hit in the first place.||Now that we've thought of these wonderful defenses, we must start researching them individually. Which is good! Well, good for us in the defense research community who need the research grants.</Details>

They are beam weapons which are useful in space where ships are firing great distances, but they aren't very powerful. Still, something is better than nothing.||The Laser series of weapons works through a series of weaponized mirror technology. Rushed into service in order to deal with the hostility of the galaxy, the energy (i.e., light) is refracted from the mirrors into a single "beam." Our technology in this area is currently quite limited as the mirrors tend to burn out readily.||The challenge for us is to find better materials for the mirrors so that more energy can be directed and combined. Since beam weapons are effectively instantaneous, the other issue that determines weapon effectiveness is the duration. Right now, lasers have a very short duration due to the fragility of the mirrors used.</Details>

    <Description>Allows us to begin researching missile weapons.</Description>
    <Details>One of the biggest problems with space weaponry is that your target is rarely standing still,  idly waiting for you to hurt it.  Spaceships tend to move around a lot,  which causes all manner of targetting problems when you're already light-seconds away to start with.   The solution to this problem is to pack a big potential bang into a tiny little ship,  then whiz it at your target until it's close enough to do some damage.   Of course,  these tiny little ships have to be smart enough to know what a "target" is,  and how to differentiate between a "good" target (your enemy) and a "bad" target (your own ships).  And they have to have their own engines and navigational capability.  Frankly,  its intimidating.  This is not going to be easy.</Details>

    <Description>Missile weapon technology.</Description>
    <Details>Building space based missiles is a big challenge.  Speed,  target recognition,  and tracking must all be superb.||The Stinger missile project has been a very controversial project within the political community.  Unlike mass drivers or lasers,  missiles are not attenuated by planetary atmosphere.  The idea of arming ships with high-yield warheads that could potentially be used against cities has created a great deal of resistance to the entire missile development project.||To mitigate some of this resistance, we have worked towards making effective, non-nuclear warheads.||The Stinger, like all missile based systems, is very good against ships without defense. But it is easy (though not necessarily cheap) to counter missiles.  They can be blocked with chaff or interfered with through electronic counter measures (ECM). They can also be literally shot down with point defenses. So we'll have to keep one step ahead of our enemies.</Details>

This observation led to the formation of his company, General Dynometrics, which won the majority of the next set of planetary defense contracts.

Recently however, a host of new technologies related to hyperdrive have made the amplification of sub-space fields from a planets gravity well not only possible but viable for defense. With this new technology we have devised plans for a new prototype building capable of distributing the fields to both orbiting ships and critical defense installations. This sub-space field generator is being called the “Omega Defense System", as it is the ultimate way to defend a planet from invasion. However, we have also refined our soldiers training methods, for planets that don't have the defense system yet.</Details>

    <Description>A brief history of the Altarians.</Description>
    <Details>The Altarians do not call themselves Altarians. It is the term humans call the residents of the third planet orbiting Ara Centauri. Known as "The Altar", it has become simply known as Altaria since it is the only planet with intelligent life in that part of the galaxy.||The evolutionary history of the Altarians is a story on its own. The Altarians name for their own planet is loosely translated as "World". But how they evolved on this world is something of a mystery.||Long ago, a sentient species evolved from warm blooded lizard-like beings that became known as the Drath. And yet, multiple humanoid species evolved in a short amount of time despite the lack of any primate species on the planet.||There are many theories on how so many different sentient species could arise on the planet. But the various myths and religions on Altaria insist that it was the result of the presence of the dark Mithrilar Draginol whose influence caused a single humanoid species to evolve alongside the Drath. This attracted the Precursors whose conflict had not matured.||The Precursors fought a series of proxy wars using the fledgling Altarians as their clients. Different Precursors modified the young Altarians in different way resulting in a series of subspecies and early nations. The Drath found themselves in the middle of this conflict and eventually was forced to flee the world with the help of sympathetic Precursors.||In the meantime, a series of incredible wars were fought out on Altaria with different factions laying claim to the world. At the end of one particularly brutal war, the planet is nearly destroyed in what becomes known as the cataclysm. Nearly all life on the world is wiped out.||While the world recovers, the war between the Precursor factions raged across the galaxy in what becomes better known as the Arnor/Dread Lord wars. The war is concluded just as the world begins to heal itself.||The post-cataclysm Altaria recovers slowly with different factions vying for control. The world itself is littered with artifacts of the Precursor wars which threaten to ultimately destroy the world again.||Much of the history between the rebirth and modern Altaria is lost. What is known is that the modern Altarians are highly peaceful and benevolent. They also have the genetic ability to manipulate what is known as "dark energy". It is a difficult concept to grasp. Just as different species can recognize different light spectrums, the Altarians have the capability to inherently make some use of dark energy.||This inherent ability has only limited use in a technological society. As the rise of the Drengin Empire and Arcean Empires show, technology is the ultimate equalizer.||Physically, Altarians look identical to humans. They are not, however, humans. They are not genetically compatible and do not share the same DNA. But they are similar enough in DNA to ensure that there is some unknown connection between the two.</Details>

The Arnor brought them to this world thousands of years ago after their native world - Altaria, was nearly destroyed in the cataclysm when the younger species, now called Altarians, warred amongst themselves as puppets of the Precursors who recognized the potential of the Altarians.||What none of them realized is that the ultimate source of power of the Altarians was inside the planet itself. The dark Mithrilar, Draginol, after having shattered the Telenanth cyrstal of power, crashed into the world and in doing so, altered the natural evolution of the planet.||The Drath knew they had no place amongst the Altarians who multiplied at rates far beyond the Drath and most agreed to be relocated by the Arnor.||The Drath are very strong (they're huge). A human biologist once described the Drath as sentient dragons. And in fact, male Drath once had the ability to fly on great wings but lost the ability long ago. Because the Drath are so strong, they make incredible soldiers.||However, as a practical matter, the Drath prefer to manipulate things behind the scenes. The Drath simply are too few in number to get involved directly.</Details>

    <DisplayName>History of the Dread Lords</DisplayName>
    <Description>Learn the history of the Precursors.</Description>
    <Details>The Precursors were the first sentient species. They didn't call themselves Precursors naturally. They called themselves Arnor. They didn't evolve. They were made. Religion and myth have clouded the specifics of the very beginning. What we have learned (i.e. according to Precursor artifacts that have been found and translated) is that there were once 5 "guardians of the universe" who were sent to ensure that life would come to exist in the universe when the proper time came. Where they came from is unknown. But what is known to the Precursors is that the object the Guardians were to take care of was known as the Telenanth. It was a crystal of some kind (as best we can tell) that when unleashed into the universe would allow inorganic matter to become organic. The line between the two is apparently a lot thinner than previously believed (or more exactly, what the Mithrilar consider living is probably a lot looser than what we today would consider living). The Mithrilar would probably even consider proteins to be life as apparently they did not exist prior to the unleashing of the Telenanth.||According to what we have learned of the Precursors, the Mithrilar used the Telenanth to actually change the laws of physics as we know them in the universe in such a way to allow for certain types of molecular bonds to be able to form. We cannot see how this is possible as the laws of physics are absolute and any change to them would make the universe as we know it impossible. But the Precursors certainly believe that the laws of physics are fluid.||Meanwhile, one of the Mithrilar was different from the others. Known as the "Dark Mithrilar" he/it became known as Draginol. Where he originated is unknown even to the Precursors. What is known is that Draginol created the Precursors in his own image. The Arnor, in their natural form, resemble Altarians (and humans) -- this was the Altarian prophecy that came to be seen to be true once actual contact with the Dread Lords occurred. We do not know why Draginol's natural form resembles an Altarian/human. We do know that the other Mithrilar had no specific natural form at all.||The Arnor quickly built a great civilization that eventually spanned the stars across the known universe. The universe was empty with no life on it other than the Arnor and other specific forms of life created by Draginol for their planet. In time, the Telenanth was unleashed and nearly all of the guardians of the universe were no more. With the Mithrilar gone, the Precursors began to observe the rise of new sentient beings evolving across the galaxies.||In our galaxy, the first civilization to become sentient was known as the Iconians. The Arnor became concerned of what the future might hold in a universe teeming with these younger sentient races. One faction wanted to exterminate alien sentient life upon discovery. The other wanted to guide them. In time, this difference in philosophy grew into a civil war. The losing side became villainized and known as the "Dread Lords". The war was long and devastated the galaxies in which it was fought. The Arnor were on the brink of defeat but had constructed a trap to remove the Dread Lords from our dimension and place them in a pocket dimension. With that accomplished, the Precursors disappeared until the Drengin unwittingly released the Dread Lords from the pocket universe. The location of the Arnor home world is still unknown and the Arnor disappeared from the known universe soon after the Dread Lords were banished.||Some other notes about the universe according to the Precursors:||According to what we have learned, as big as the universe is, nearly all of the galaxies are lifeless and that in time, even our galaxy will become lifeless until the end when everything breaks back down to sub-atomic particles again, the price of having a universe capable of the molecular bonds provided by the Telenanth. The Mithrilar also considered all matter other than what we call hydrogen and helium to be miraculous and that all elements other than those two were created due to the Telenanth's initial effect on the singularity force of the universe.</Details>

    <Details>The Iconians, in their quest to have servants of their own, constructed ever more advanced machines to labor for them. Just as the Iconians were servants of the Precursors, so too did these near-sentient machines act as servants to the Iconians.||During the civil war between the Precursors, the faction known today as the Dread Lords modified the robotic servants of the Iconians to achieve sentience. Thus was born the malevolent race known as the Yor. The Yor quickly sought to exterminate their creators. They did so first using a biological plague since, at first, the Iconians vastly outnumbered the Yor. With the population of the Iconians decimated, the Yor then set upon the scattered survivors methodically in an effort to wipe out the remaining groups.||With some help from the Arnor, the Iconians escaped to a distant world now known as "New Iconia". To this day, Iconia is inhabited by the Yor.||While the Iconians lost much of their technology, so skilled were they in the construction of robots that this is an area that the Iconians continue to lead. Of course, they are very careful now to construct their servants such that they are nowhere near what could be considered sentient.</Details>

    <Details>The Iconian civilization is the only civilization that existed during the noontide of the Precursors. Before the Precursor civil war, which saw that civilization break into two factions now known as the Arnor and the Dread Lords, the Iconians were the servants of the Precursors.||In time, the Precursor war saw the Iconians as unwitting pawns in their struggle. The Precursor civilization resulted in the near extinction of the Iconian race. However, the Iconians have far more knowledge of the Precursors than any others.||Unfortunately, Iconian culture has not lent itself to technological research. Economics, industry, and research as we know them to be are completely foreign to the Iconians. The Iconians replicated the Precursor way of life in all its forms. The Precursors, however, were potent because of their innate being. That is, the source of Precursor power was inherent. By contrast, the Iconians are a biological organism that evolved over millions of years on Iconia. As a result, the Iconians were always little more than a pale reflection of their masters.||The challenge of the Iconians is to develop a modern economic, cultural, and manufacturing civilization. To jump start this the Iconians have access to a great number of partially translated works of the Precursors to call upon.</Details>

    <Details>Our universe exists in 11 dimensions. There are also a near-infinite number of universes that are connected to each of those 11 dimensions. Destroying a universe is a non-trivial effort. And yet, somehow, the primitive species of this space-time have managed to do just that. Specifically, the species known as humans, in their near-future, manage to create such utter destruction that the resulting ruin feeds upon itself and permeates all of creation throughout every dimension.||The only bright side to this is that this destruction travels at the speed of light. The downside is that the destruction moves at the speed of light through folded space which means it will engulf the universe in far less than the 13 billion of their years that it would otherwise require.||We have thus brought a single strike force through dimension 4 to this particular universe in the hopes of averting this apocalypse. Thus far, the humans do not seem to be the type to unleash the kind of destruction that they apparently destined to do. But they are not what they seem to be either. The humans in their government, the Terran Alliance, attempt to provide a diplomatic, peaceful coexistent front-end to their activities. They genuinely seem to be interested in living in peace.||And yet, these same peaceful humans are incredibly ruthless when motivated. For example, we have learned that only 10 years (human years) ago, the humans wiped out a civilization known as the Xendar. The humans fight what they call "total wars" which is in contrast to the skirmishes that other civilizations seem to fight. That is, humans seem to resist war to a point but once a threshold has been passed, the humans fight to win for all time.||In the current time, the galaxy is beset by an immense war with multiple factions. The most powerful faction is called the Drengin Empire. They are a ruthless, evil civilization whose motivation is control and conquest. Their brethren, the Korath, are xenophobic and wish to wipe out all non-Drengin life. The two are struggling for control. The Korath are quite obviously being manipulated by the remnants of a the malevolent Arnor civilization called "Dread Lords" who lack the numbers to conquer the galaxy through open arms but are potent enough to use pawns to accomplish their ends.||At the same time, the main human fleet has disappeared to where we do not know. But not before leaving Earth protected by an Arnorian shield that nothing can penetrate leaving the Drengin frustrated in their attempts to final victory over the Terran Alliance. The Terran Alliance still has a handful of task forces in the galaxy who are quite capable of being every bit as brutal as the Drengin when necessary.||And then there are the other civilizations who have chosen sides. Our concern is with the humans. Our goal is to build up enough of a force so that when we identify the cause of the ruin, we can act.</Details>

Our objective is to research technologies that will aid us in making use of our vast technological advantages before external threats overcome us.</Details>

    <Description>The sad history of the Torian species.</Description>
    <Details>The Torians have had a tortured history - literally. Conquered by the Drengin Empire when they were largely a nomadic, semi-aquatic race, the Torians fought to liberate their homeworld from the Drengin. Eventually, they made it too expensive for the Drengin to stay and in the pre-hyperdrive era of space travel, the Drengin simply chose to leave.||This left the Torians with a devastated world that was filled with mysterious machinery and technology they could scarcely understand. Over the course of hundreds of years, the Torians managed to reverse-engineer the technology and began using it.||However, the Torians, as a culture, are not well suited towards engineering and manufacturing. Their culture is, ultimately, that of a pre-industrial species. Their greatest strength is their ability to reproduce quickly.</Details>

    <Description>A history of a cybernetic species.</Description>
    <Details>The Yor are the first and only race of sentient machines. All other civilizations that have been found that are synthetic and sentient are in one way or the other an off-shoot of the Yor.||How the Yor achieved sentience is not well known. However, it is believed that the Precursor civilization known today as the "Dread Lords" gave the cybernetic creations of the Iconian race the spark of sentience. That sentience put the Yor on the evolutionary path that has brought them to where they are today.</Details>
